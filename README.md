# handwritten-digit-recognition
This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the popular MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits and is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

In this project, we use a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn relevant features from input images.

The main components of the project include:

- Data loading and preprocessing: The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed to be suitable for training and testing the CNN model.
- CNN architecture: A CNN architecture is defined and configured for digit classification.
- Training: The model is trained on the training dataset using the configured architecture and hyperparameters.
- Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its accuracy and performance.
- Prediction: You can use the trained model to predict the digits in your own images.

## Installation
